## Global Benefits Strategy & Stipend

### Benefits Strategy & Philosophy

As a global company, below are our guiding principles that we follow when designing our benefit and perks programs, globally.

- We strive to provide benefits that are both locally relevant and competitive.
    - Each Country‚Äôs benefits will differ based on local norms and local competition for benefits.
- Our benefit offerings and coverage will grow and progress as team sizes grow in each country. This is due to economies of scale and eligibility of various plans we can offer.
    - If local teams aren‚Äôt large enough to begin group plans, we‚Äôll provide monthly stipends to cover core benefits (Medical, Vision & Dental - where applicable)
- Values aligned: We are Human ‚Üí Although we may not be able to implement every benefit or offering,we understand that we bring our whole selves to work and we want to hear and respond to feedback.

#### How does this apply today?

Today our global team falls into one of two buckets. 

**Employed through an EOR (Employee of Record) -** Employees that are hired and work for an EOR are subject to the benefits offerings that are provided through their service. However, we will operate within our philosophy above which means we will elect premium coverage and options as they become available through the EOR. Additionally, all related perks remain available and intact for team members employed through an EOER (ie. Office stipends, Professional Development, etc).

**Employed through a dbt Labs local entity** - Employees that are hired and work for local entities in a country with less than 10 local employees will be provided a locally relevant and competitive monthly stipend amount to reimburse some of the cost associated with finding personal coverage for core supplemental benefits (Medical, Vision & Dental), where applicable. All mandatory benefits, pension schemes, etc. will be provided to comply with local laws and regulations. 

As employee counts grow to locally relevant critical mass for group plans, we will work with our Global Benefits Broker to shop and obtain group plans that would replace the stipend amount. It‚Äôs important to note that our employee count has a direct impact on the options and plans that will be available and we will only pursue this when it benefits the employees in each location.

### Local Entity Medical Benefit Stipends

The following stipend amounts have been developed to help cover some of the cost to acquire additional supplemental insurance until we are able to offer local group plans. You can use this stipend to cover core benefits like medical, dental, vision, life & disability for yourself and dependents, if applicable.

#### Monthly Stipend Amount

| Country        	| # Gross Stipend Amount (Local Currency) 	| Local Currency 	|
|----------------	|-----------------------------------------	|----------------	|
| Australia      	| 673                                     	| AUD            	|
| Germany        	| 183                                     	| EUR            	|
| New Zealand    	| 730                                     	| NZD            	|
| United Kingdom 	| 268                                     	| GBP            	|
| Sweden         	| 1418                                    	| SEK            	|
| Finland        	| 183                                     	| EUR            	|

### Receiving the Benefits Stipend

The benefits stipend will automatically be added to your monthly payroll. You do not need to request a reimbursement.

### Retirement & Pension Plans

We look to target locally relevant and competitive benefit options. Retirement and pension plans fall under the same philosophy. We are currently working towards getting each required pension scheme and retirement plan solidified and will update here once we have more information.

## Healthcare Benefits (US)

Full-time team members based in the US are eligible to enroll in healthcare benefits through dbt Labs. We provide medical, dental and vision benefits to employees and their dependents as well as FSA, DCFSA, and HSA options. 

Health benefits are paid, in part, by the company. The remainder of the costs is the employee‚Äôs responsibility.

An overview of our benefits can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Healthcare-Benefits-Overview-US-650cf65d9612445a8d7ce41e936b307f?pvs=4) and find a detailed overview on our benefits [website](https://app.strivebenefits.com/dbt/home).

The details our benefits can be found on the [benefit website](https://app.strivebenefits.com/dbt/home).

### How To Enroll in Healthcare Benefits (US)

Benefit enrollment takes place through ADP and you can learn more about the process [here](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/US-Health-Benefit-Enrollment-Guide-8132d651bdc54fddb8c3c6251701d5d5?pvs=4).

There are four separate occasions where team members may enroll in, or change, benefits throughout the calendar year. 

1. [New Hire Enrollment](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/US-Health-Benefit-Enrollment-Guide-8132d651bdc54fddb8c3c6251701d5d5?pvs=4#2eebaae383f64dada3d4652570bdbf73): New hires may enroll themselves and dependents in health benefits online through ADP within the first 30 days of employment. There is a strict 30 day enrollment window. After benefit elections are submitted, enrollments go into effect as of your first day of employment (your start date) at dbt Labs.
2. [Open Enrollment](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/US-Health-Benefit-Enrollment-Guide-8132d651bdc54fddb8c3c6251701d5d5?pvs=4#87c60e30f9b645ef99865ad0c2c75ccf):dbt Labs has an annual Open Enrollment (OE) at the end of the calendar year, typically in November or early December. During open enrollment, team members have the opportunity to review or change their benefit elections. Benefit enrollments go into effect January 1st of the following calendar year.
3. [Qualifying Life Event](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/US-Health-Benefit-Enrollment-Guide-8132d651bdc54fddb8c3c6251701d5d5?pvs=4#32b0e31ce6884a9e95fbb988a7b5d78b):There are times when life changes unexpectedly. Often times, those events may happen outside of Open Enrollment (OE). Enrollment in essential health coverage is allowed outside of OE if you experience a qualifying life event. Examples of QLEs include marriage, childbirth, and loss of coverage. Team members can submit a life event online in ADP. 
4. [Year Round HSA Adjustment](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/US-Health-Benefit-Enrollment-Guide-8132d651bdc54fddb8c3c6251701d5d5?pvs=4#bb07dd31ff8542df92ac1f46a288a88a): Employees who currently have a High Deductible Health Plan coverage selection are able to adjust their HSA contributions throughout the year. This is the only benefit adjustment that does not require a Qualifying Life or Work Event.

### How to Get Support with Healthcare Benefits (US)

We understand there are a lot of questions about chosing and navigating healthcare. 

Learn how to ask questions through our partner Newfront Answers [here](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/How-to-Get-Support-with-Healthcare-Benefits-US-9bb7ff3a7a944918bbca648f27ce8eb8?pvs=4).

### International Travel Emergency Health Benefits (US)

Eligibility Requirement: US employees enrolled in dbt Labs' health benefits.

US employees utilizing our health benefits have access to emergency care while traveling abroad. 

Emergencies are generally classified as any symptoms that might be ‚Äúlimb or life threatening‚Äù, which could be something like broken limb, chest pain, anaphylaxis/allergy reactions causing severe symptoms, etc. If you are not sure if something is considered an emergency, contact your doctor. 

Both Cigna and Kaiser have access to Registered Nurses who are available 24/7 to assess medical conditions over the phone and make suggestions for care (find these numbers¬†on the back of your insurance card).

Learn how to use this benefit [here](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Int-l-Travel-Emergency-Health-Benefits-US-Employees-d607183ad6214ccfa853c9b5addb2ff7?pvs=4).

## Health-Related Travel Benefit

üìå We believe that our team members must have access to the healthcare that they need, no matter where they live. Therefore, dbt Labs will reimburse up to USD$4,000 in travel expenses annually[^1] to cover gaps in access for any team member (including their dependent(s)) who are required to travel to obtain medical care that is not available in their country or state of residence.

Many local governments in the US and globally have introduced legislation to reduce or restrict access to critical healthcare, including but not limited to reproductive health care, abortion care, and gender-affirming care. This is not aligned with our values at dbt Labs, and the Health-Related Travel Benefit is designed to support our team members who are required to travel to obtain necessary medical care.
[^1]: Resets with the fiscal year on February 1. 

**Eligible travel expenses include:**

- Transportation (reasonable flights, trains, taxis, buses, etc)
- Reasonable Lodging
- Meals
- Transportation, lodging and meals expenses for one support person who accompanies the team member.

The net maximum annual benefit (for each team member and their dependents combined) is USD $4,000. Reimbursements will be paid directly from dbt Labs (not submitted for reimbursement to any health insurance benefit or any other employee benefits program), and be added directly to payroll.

dbt Labs has a [form that the provider clinic will need to complete](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gxRDUYSQf_KVYXl4TbR-xfgxLYWKbJmUmyKDv9XRjxU/edit?usp=sharing) and return to verify and distribute reimbursements. dbt Labs does not need any information about the type of healthcare received. All information collected in connection with this benefit will be maintained subject to dbt Lab‚Äôs employee privacy policies.

### Global

dbt Labs offers this benefit in compliance with all local and international laws and our health insurance and similar employee benefits programs. Anyone employed through an EOR (Employer of Record) or through a dbt Labs local entity should reach out to Megan Pittman (megan.pittman@dbtlabs.com) before planning travel.

### US
In order to maintain privacy and ensure that employees are comfortable leveraging this reimbursement, please follow the process below:
1. Have the provider clinic send the completed health-related travel benefit form directly to Megan Pittman (megan.pittman@dbtlabs.com). Please do not include any information about the type of healthcare received.
2. Email receipts directly to Megan Pittman (megan.pittman@dbtlabs.com). Please include a note that the receipts are for healthcare-related travel benefit expenses, but we do not require more information than that.
3. Reimbursements will be processed directly through payroll.

If you have questions or need support relating to out-of-state travel for healthcare purposes, please contact Megan Pittman (megan.pittman@dbtlabs.com) directly.


## Retirement (US)

All US based employees have access to an employer-sponsored 401K plan, adminstered through [Guideline](https://www.guideline.com/). 

Immediately upon hire, dbt Labs will contribute 3% of employee‚Äôs monthly salary into their retirement account on a monthly basis and employees will be automatically enrolled at 4% contributions, which can be adjusted at any time. 

Employees can additionally opt to contribute up to the federal maximum to their retirement account. dbt Labs will contribute to the retirement account regardless of any supplemental employee contributions.

3. Employees‚Äôs are automatically enrolled at a default contribution rate of 4%.

### Automatic Contribution Amounts

## Stipends

These policies apply to all full-time employees that work for any dbt Labs entity or who are employed through our Employer of Record (EOR - ie, Remote.com).

### How to use Benepass - Perks & Stipend Platform

Benepass is our benefits/perks partner and is specifically designed to help administer stipends and supplemental perks. 

Learn about how to use Benepass and get answers to FAQs [here](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Perks-Stipends-60efa8c883aa4354b361baeefb86c2c9?pvs=4#b4463cef29e54a4c9d1a9fe137f7282e).

- Benepass is used for Office Stipend, Phone & Internet Stipend, Health & Wellness Stipend, and Professional Development Stipend. 
- Policies and reimbursements that are NOT administered through Benepass are: Workspace Rental Stipend, Health Related Travel Benefit, Corporate Travel & Expense Policy.
- Benepass can be accessed via Okta, their [Online Portal](https://app.getbenepass.com/#/) or through their mobile [app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/benepass/id1497613952). 

### General Guidelines for All Stipends

- All stipend expenses must be processed using your Benepass card or submitted for reimbursement through the Benepass app. [Learn more here.](#how-to-use-benepass---perks--stipend-platform)
- All transactions over $50 USD or local equivalent require a receipt / documentation
    - All reimbursements require a receipt / documentation
- All full time employees are eligible for these stipends in their first month, regardless of their actual hire date.
- Stipend amounts must be used within their allotted time or the **funds will expire** (ie. Each stipend expires at the end of the fiscal year (Feb 1-Jan 31) or end of the month. Funds not used during that time period will expire and will not roll over)
    - **Expired Health & Wellness Funds example**: On July 18th your Benepass card is charged for your gym membership for $100, reducing your Health & Wellness available funds to $25. On July 25th you purchase a sleeve of golf balls for $15 on your personal card. On August 1st your Health and Wellness wallet‚Äôs remaining $25 from July expire and is then refreshed to $125 for the month of August. August 2nd you submit for a reimbursement for the golf balls and the $15 is reimbursed and deducts the $15 from the available $125 August amount.
- Stipend amounts will be evaluated on an annual basis (Key factors - benchmark data, purchasing power indices, budget availability)
- Annual Stipends must be submitted in a timely fashion, best practice is to submit expenses within 30 days.
    - Past 30 day submissions: while you can still submit these expenses past 30 days, this best practice helps ensure we aren‚Äôt back-loading and incurring large sums of reimbursements as we close out a Quarter or Fiscal year and timely submissions help with this!
- View a list of **[eligible expenses](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/350f3daf90364931abc7ab91c8922a5f?v=d3e383bfd15b41419355b44e86096a66&pvs=4)**. This list is non-comprehensive and is updated as needed.

## Workplace Rental 

We understand that working from home does not work for everyone. All dbt Labs employees receive a monthly benefit to rent office space and experience an optimal work environment.

**This benefit is important because:**

- **Productivity**: Our remote-first, async culture empowers employees to "work from anywhere," not just "work from home." The ***primary goal*** of offering workplaces outside the home is to enable employees to create their ideal work environment.
- **Community:**¬†Provides opportunities for team members to build rapport with one another, engage cross-functionally, and strengthen a sense of shared values and goals.

**üñêÔ∏è Use this benefit thoughtfully:** In-person or external workplace benefits shouldn't impede remote employees' collaboration. The primary aim is to enhance your work environment. When collaborating in a co-working space, ensure you include all necessary participants. If a project or collaboration can be effectively managed via Zoom or asynchronously, opt for those methods to avoid excluding anyone.

### Budget

- **Individual Budget:** Employees can use or expense up to **$300 per month** (or localized international rate) on a workplace rental option for their individual use.
- **Leader Budget:** Directors (L7+) and above can book larger conference room / work spaces to support in-person meetings for teams up to **$1500 per quarter** (or localized international rate)**.** For offsites, work with your [finance business partner](https://www.notion.so/Business-Partner-Coverage-Model-0a4ee30503464b3bb101de1d4c3ac5e8?pvs=21) to evaluate options within your org‚Äôs travel budget.

### Workplace Rental Options
