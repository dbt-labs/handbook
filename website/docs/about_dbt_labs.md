## Welcome
Hello and welcome to dbt Labs. We’re thrilled to have you as a member of the team!

This handbook is intended to answer your questions as a new employee and should serve as a valuable resource throughout your employment. Read on to learn about important company policies and procedures, as well as the commitments we have to our employees.

### dbt Labs is Merging with Fivetran
A quick heads up: we’re in a transition period. [dbt Labs and Fivetran have signed an agreement to merge](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-labs-and-fivetran-merge-announcement), with the goal of becoming one company in early 2026. As we integrate, this public handbook may lag behind internal updates.

If you're an employee, please use our internal resources for the most current guidance. We look forward to sharing more about our updated policies and public documentation as our new company takes shape.
