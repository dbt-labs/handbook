## Annual Review Cadence

üåè *Note that all dates below are formatted by US dates, so it will be MM/DD*


### There are two types of review cycles at dbt Labs.

[Performance Reviews at dbt Labs](https://www.notion.so/Performance-Reviews-at-dbt-Labs-054564274f6042a09e1e8515df579e06) 

[Compensation Reviews and Promotion Cycles](https://www.notion.so/Compensation-Reviews-and-Promotion-Cycles-3cd43b727be1471c991cb6964bae4ccd) 

### Cadence

<aside>
üëâ Each review cycle happens twice per year, meaning we have 4 cycles **total**.

</aside>

Because of the relationship between performance, and compensation/ promotions, the review cycles are close together, while being separate. This also means that our operating calendar has space for large events (company kick off and Coalesce, for example) to happen without a review cycle in tandem.

## Internal Mobility

### Overview

This document applies to those interested in applying to a role outside of your immediate team. Typically, this role will need to be an open requisition with an approved headcount.

Below is also a link to our internal career site, where we post open roles (this is regularly updated, and we are posting roles based on the quarter it is allocated for):

[Greenhouse](https://app5.greenhouse.io/internal_job_board/)

### Eligibility

#### Intra-Department Transfers

We recommend employees be in their role for at least 9 months before applying to an open requisition within their own department. *(Example: Analytics Engineer ‚Üí Technical Instructor)*

**Why a minimum of 9 months?** The reason we are asking for 9 months for an intra-department transfer is because we recognize that there are more transferrable skills and knowledge that exist across roles within a department. 

#### Cross-Department Transfers

We ask that employees be in their role for **at least** 12 months before applying to an open requisition within another department. *(Example: Customer Support Engineer ‚Üí Solutions Architect)*

**Why the minimum of 12 months?** We ask for at least 12 months for a cross-department transfer because it can take about 3 months to onboard onto a new role and another 3 months to become completely ramped into that role (totaling up to 6 months). We would want someone to be working as a ramped member of the team for at **least** 6, ideally 12 months, before moving on. Additionally it could take us longer to backfill your role meaning there are more limitations for the team during the transition period and beyond if you‚Äôre switching to a new department. 

**Exceptions:** Changes or movement between teams could happen at any time due to business need. If your tenure with dbt Labs is less than the 9 or 12 months and you are interested in moving internally, bring this up to your People Business Partner - People Ops and your current leadership team will need to approve the business exception.

**Again, please ensure you‚Äôre actively talking to your manager about your career goals and development wants/needs.** 

### Internal Transfer and Application Process

#### Step 1: Explore your interests

1. Look at the [internal career site](https://app5.greenhouse.io/internal_job_board/) to see which roles you might be interested in.
2. Reach out to your [People Business Partner](https://www.notion.so/People-Business-Partners-7c4b9fca56e245e684bd8d8e79f65910) to confirm eligibility for internal mobility.
3. Reach out to the [recruiter](https://www.notion.so/Business-Partner-Coverage-Model-0a4ee30503464b3bb101de1d4c3ac5e8) and hiring manager to have an introductory call:
    1. Explain why you are interested in learning more about this role. In your conversation, understand the role expectations and hiring profile.
    2. If you would like to learn more about the role, we recommend shadowing someone who is on the existing team or in the current role to learn more about the day to day.
    3. Feel free to also meet with existing members of the team to understand the landscape of the team, advise they may have, or general mentorship.
4. At the end of the introductory call, you can also ask the hiring manager if they think you would be good fit for the role at this time. The hiring manager might be able to help you identify areas you can develop prior to pursuing the role, or recommend other roles to look into if they conclude another team or role would be better suited for you, your interests, and/or skill set.

#### Step 2: Apply

1. If after intro conversation you want to formally apply:
    1. First have a conversation with your current manager about your intention to apply.
        - While you do not need their permission to apply for the new role, we encourage you to be transparent with them as it's unfair to have them find out through the grapevine (which they inevitably will in our smaller org).
        - You can also use this as an opportunity to discuss any feedback and your reasons for pursuing the new opportunity.
        - This will also be a great way to open up the discussion for performance feedback and career progression.
    2. Apply to the role in [Greenhouse](https://app5.greenhouse.io/internal_job_board/).

#### Step 3: Interview

1. After you have applied to the role in Greenhouse, a recruiter or the hiring manager will reach out to you to move you through the interview process. 
    - With the Recruiter, there will be a series of questions to answer:
        - How long have you been in your current role?
        - Have you chatted with your current manager about your interest?
        - Why do you want this specific role?
        - Have you reached out to someone to learn about this role?

The interview process will be a shortened version of the external process, but overall will vary department by department based on role and skills required. Some roles might require a task or skills assessment. If you have questions about this, the recruiting team can share more with you.

#### Step 4: Application Status

After you go through the interview process, you will hear back from the hiring manager or recruiter about your application and if you will be getting the role or not.

**If you do not get the role**, do not be discouraged! The hiring manager will pass over feedback to your current manager and we hope this will be an opportunity to come up with a development plan for you. You are always welcome to apply again.

**If you do get the role**, you can expect a confirmation in writing from the hiring manager or People Ops. You will also have a meeting scheduled with your current manager and new manager to go over things like:

1. Transition plan - knowledge transfer timing and actions
    1. Don‚Äôt worry if you do not transfer to your new team immediately, there is a minimum of a 2-week transition period. ***This may be extended to allow time to backfill your role**
        
        Your transfer date will be established by your current and new manager based on the time it will take to close out current projects and/or hiring a backfill. This will vary team to team.
        
2. Your career goals and going over what you may have already worked on with your current manager (progress towards your goals)
3. Your past performance reviews
4. Expectations in the new role (30/60/90 day plan)

### **Country Hiring Guidelines**

The dbt Labs team has members in countries and regions all over the world and from all walks of life. We value diversity. As we grow we will continue to explore our hiring capabilities in a variety of geographies.

All of our roles are remote, however some roles may carry specific location or time zone-based eligibility requirements. Our Talent Acquisition team can help answer any questions applicants may have about location after starting the recruiting process.

In the past, dbt Labs would hire in any country except those we had already determined were not feasible due to certain restrictions. At present we are focusing our hiring in countries where we have¬†entities; exceptions will be made rarely and must have approval by our CFO*. For exceptions, we ask for a 6 month lead time so that we can properly investigate employing someone in that country and take necessary steps to be able to do so legally.

*To request an exception:

1. Please contact the Head of People with the following:
    1. The country
    2. The role you would like to hire in that country
    3. Why this country over one where we have an entity.
2. The G&A team (Finance, Accounting, Legal and People) will investigate the benefits and risks of entering there

**With this process; there are 3 types of employment relationships:**

1. Direct employment with a dbt Labs entity
    1. We will look into opening in entities in countries that we have a large employee count or if there is a business case where an entity would be beneficial.
2. Non-resident payroll through our dbt Labs entity
3. EOR employment through our current* vendor Remote.com, legally, this relationship is a contractor relationship
    1. *Vendor relationship subject to change to accommodate business and team member needs.

### Global Compensation and Benefits

[dbt Labs Compensation Principles](compensation.md#compensation-principles) 

[Global Benefits Strategy & Stipend](https://www.notion.so/Global-Benefits-Strategy-Stipend-03b4ebfbb278451f894a4cca46c90607)

In the past, we have hired internationally using our US-based compensation bands. As we are growing that presence internationally, our approach here will have to change in order to create efficiency and scalability with our growth. To that end, we will apply our compensation philosophy to each country we employ in. 

This is because the labor markets, benefits, pension/superannuation schemes and payroll taxes can vary greatly country to country. This approach insures that we are offering equitable (not equal) compensation in each market.

We are¬†paying **local country rates**¬†based on¬†[cost of market (also referred to as cost of labor)](https://www.erieri.com/blog/post/cost-of-labor-vs-cost-of-living). This means we will align our compensation with the top (75th - 90th percentile) in each country (looking at ‚ÄùAll UK‚Äù ‚ÄúAll Germany‚Äù, ‚ÄúAll Australia‚Äù, etc.)

### Relocation (Permanent or Semi-permanent)

üìå All international relocation requests must be approved by the People team, Finance team and the team members management. To initiate a request, please contact your People Business Partner.

[People Business Partners](https://www.notion.so/People-Business-Partners-7c4b9fca56e245e684bd8d8e79f65910)

üìå Relocation requests within country may need approval by the team members management due to time zone or regional requirements. Please communicate with your manager if you plan a move to a different region in your country.

If a team member chooses to relocate within each country (ex. from London ‚Üí Manchester or Boston ‚Üí Chicago), their compensation will not change. However, if the relocation is to a different country, they will be re-aligned to the new country‚Äôs compensation bands. This applies both when moving to a lower and higher cost market. 

Compensation bands for each country we have an entity in will be listed in our compensation database. As we grow, new data will be added to capture roles located in each country.

**What to consider before moving?**

‚è≥ Please initiate a move at least 3 months before your target move date. This allows us to process necessary approvals and make sure we‚Äôre able to execute the transfer.


1. If the team member is moving to a new country, the move must have prior approval by their People Business Partner, the dbt Labs finance team, their manager and their team‚Äôs leadership.
    1. Please allow for one month for approvals.
2. All moves should be to a country where we have a dbt Labs entity. 
    1. Any international moves outside of countries we have a presence in, must be approved by the CFO and be to a location where there is a business case. We ask for a 6 month lead time to determine if this move is possible
3. Team members must obtain their own work authorization to work in the country they are moving to. For moves initiated by the team member, dbt Labs will not cover expenses for work authorization. 
4. If a move is initiated by a team member, we will not cover any relocation or living expenses. 
5. We encourage team members to consult with a tax advisor to understand the implications of the move as it relates to tax and equity. 
    1. **Please remember that your compensation will be updated to reflect the local market you are moving to.**  

### Short term relocation.

üìÖ Generally, team members may live or work outside their permanent residence for an aggregate amount of 183 days (6 months) per year. However, the amount does depend on the particular country (or state) and what it considers to be a "resident" for tax purposes, as well as what it considers the tax year.


Any work being done in a country where we do not have a current presence must be approved by security to ensure access to our systems remains secure. Please submit a ticket with IT prior to confirming your working arrangements in that country. 

If a team member is considering spending more than **one month** in a location outside of your home country, please consult with your People Business Partner to ensure we are mitigating risks to the team member and the business. 

Team members are expected to communicate with their manager and team to ensure they maintain agreed upon working hours.

### Equity

**ISO Options:**  If a team member chooses to relocate and holds ISO options, the number of options that are unvested will be converted to NSO options.  If the team member has options that vested as ISOs, they will be able to retain the ISO status.  When the team member relocates, the Equity team will cancel the existing ISO grant(s) and reissue NSO grant(s) for the unvested portion of the original grant within Carta.  The grant will retain all of the other original terms (strike price, vesting period, etc.)

**NSO options:**  If a team member chooses to relocate and holds NSO options, nothing will change.

üöß There are different tax consequences for ISO and NSO options.  Additionally, tax rules vary across jurisdictions.  Employees are strongly encouraged to consult with a tax advisor before making any relocation decision.

‚ÄºÔ∏è **If there is a lapse in providing services to the Company, this will qualify as a termination and all unvested options will be canceled.  If a team member is rehired and resumes providing services to the Company, any grant associated with employment will need to go through the new hire process for equity.  This means that a team member would receive a new strike price, vesting period, etc.**

## Moonlighting Guidance
What you do in your own time is your business, including additional employment. We understand that many employees are involved in their communities in a variety of ways, paid and unpaid. However, dbt Labs employees are expected to comply with certain guidelines for work and other activities spent outside of your dbt Labs working hours (‚Äù[moonlighting](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/moonlighting)‚Äù), to ensure such activities do not interfere with, conflict with or put the company at risk.  We encourage transparency, and provide these guidelines for you to consider and discuss with your manager. Acceptable moonlighting:

(1) is not during working hours that you set with dbt Labs (whatever those hours may be - the hours that you agreed upon with your manager);

(2) isn‚Äôt performed on dbt Labs materials/property/hardware/systems;

(3) is not being provided on behalf of dbt Labs, i.e., the activity is completely unrelated and unaffiliated with dbt Labs, your client is under no assumption that they‚Äôre receiving dbt Labs services, you don‚Äôt represent yourself as acting or speaking for dbt Labs, etc;

(4) does not involve using or disclosing any confidential information or otherwise breaching any of your obligations with dbt Labs, including those under your agreements with dbt Labs; and

(5) does not conflict with the work you‚Äôre doing for dbt Labs, including, but not limited to, (i) doing work for a competitor of dbt Labs or (ii) doing work for an entity that one of our customers would take serious issue with (not necessarily a competitor of our client, but maybe an entity causing direct harm to our client. If in doubt, talk to the People team). 

Lastly, moonlighting is not an excusable reason for lesser or poor performance for work at dbt Labs. dbt Labs reserves the right to prohibit (or revoke a prior opinion that the activity was not prohibited) an employee from engaging in any moonlighting it deems may not be in the best interest of the company.

Thanks to all our employees whose energy and commitment makes dbt Labs and the larger community a better place!

## [Conscientious Objection](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Conscientious-Objection-371207f8f01c4e94bd4e62eb5c85087c?pvs=4)

### Conscientious objection is the right of an individual to withhold their labor.

Individual employees have the ability to opt out of working on a project or with a client that violates a deeply-held conviction.

We each commit to bringing our whole self to work. Conscientious objection makes space for when a major part of our self conflicts with a major part of our work. 

An example from [Tristan‚Äôs writing on this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12nAw4podecG2JWNcslAMlakujmATzXdgkCbfwLPR0sI/view#):

‚ÄúWe ask an employee, who happens to be vegan, to work closely with Tyson Foods. This employee does the work and does it well, but it‚Äôs a major engagement that takes ~a third of their time for many months. After a month, this employee becomes frustrated and starts to look for other jobs.

The problem we‚Äôre trying to solve here is individual misery created by forcing someone to do work that violates a deeply-held conviction.‚Äù

Conscientious objection applies when a high percentage of your time is directed towards a single client or project for a prolonged period (weeks or months). This will mostly apply to the pro-serv team, some SA and SD relationships, and some implementation engineering. 

üó£Ô∏è **If your work conflicts with your deeply held beliefs, talk to your manager.**

If you are assigned to a project or long-term relationship with a client that violates your deeply held beliefs, communicate to your manger that you want to be reassigned to a different project or client. Your manager must work in good faith to accommodate the request. If your work is going to make you miserable and hurt your soul, the whole team will suffer‚Äî it‚Äôs in everyone‚Äôs best interest to make a change. [Again, from Tristan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12nAw4podecG2JWNcslAMlakujmATzXdgkCbfwLPR0sI/view#): 

‚ÄúThis is not their direct report ‚Äònot being a team player‚Äô‚Äîrather, it is their direct report optimizing for the long-term. Managers who fail to accommodate such requests risk having high-turnover teams, which will limit their own ability to be successful.‚Äù

If you need additional support working with your manager to figure out an accommodation, you can reach out to your People Business Partner, @Meg Colon (Head of People), or @Morgan Russell (DEI Coordinator). 

üõ† **We can help find other solutions when conscientious objection doesn‚Äôt solve the problem**

If work that conflicts with your deeply held beliefs is a regular and predictable part of your role rather than an exception, and your right to conscientious objection is impeding the team‚Äôs overall success, the best long-term solution may be to look for a role that‚Äôs a better fit. You can work with your manager and your People Business Partner to move towards a different role within the company that is more aligned with your personal values. 

üí° You can see some of the discussion that led to this policy in [Working Document: Conscientious Objection](https://www.notion.so/Working-Document-Conscientious-Objection-31977f6aa61b447fabc4f5ac6a20f02f).
