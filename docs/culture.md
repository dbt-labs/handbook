## Distributed Work Experience

Learn how we think about the distributed experience.

#### üìò First, let‚Äôs define some terms‚Ä¶

- **Workplace Strategy:** Workplace strategy answers the question: ‚ÄúWhere do we work that optimizes for effectiveness and efficiency?‚Äù. Possible answers include: fully distributed, hybrid, office-only.
- **Asynchronous Work:** A way of working that does not require all team members to be online simultaneously. Asynchronous work is required for teams to function across multiple time zones. Often when we say ‚Äúdistributed work‚Äù we actually mean ‚Äúdistributed and asynchronous work‚Äù because our company is spread across many time zones globally. ‚ÄúDistributed‚Äù is commonly used as shorthand.
- **Employee Experience:** The journey an employee takes with an organization. It includes every interaction that happens along the employee life cycle, including the experiences that involve an employee's role, workspace, manager and wellbeing.

- **Distributed Work Experience (simply, "Distributed Experience"):** The employee experience specifically related to how work gets done in a distributed work environment. Communication, tools, processes and culture enable distributed work. The distributed experience could be liberating or constraining, agile or inflexible, fast or slow, equitable or inequitable. When you find yourself saying something like ‚ÄúI never know where to find information‚Äù you are making a comment about your personal distributed experience.

#### üåê What is our workplace strategy?

Our workplace strategy is **fully distributed**. This does not mean we won‚Äôt gather in person and won‚Äôt have office space. Instead, it means that the primary mode of getting work done assumes employees are not physically in the same location. We believe this is better for both our company and its employees.

#### ‚ú® What is our approach to support the distributed experience?

A great distributed experience doesn‚Äôt just happen on its own. Employees have been working in offices for a *very long time* and have evolved norms of behavior for how work gets done. Distributed work is far newer. As a result, we can‚Äôt rely on a shared understanding of how to work effectively in this context. We must be extremely *intentional* about how the distributed experience is constructed. When done successfully, we are confident the distributed experience is more effective, enjoyable, and equitable than traditional office-based work.

**Intentionally designing a distributed experience includes:**

- Defining cultural principles and norms of behavior that support distributed work
- Investing in tooling and processes that support distributed work
- Training everyone on how work gets done in a distributed work environment

#### ü§î Why does the distributed experience matter?

Having a great distributed experience helps both our company and our employees. It also helps us live our values.

- **Benefits for dbt Labs**
    - **Widens our talent pool:** Without the limitations of a physical location, we can hire top talent across the globe.
    - **Productivity:** Our team spends less time in meetings and has more time to focus.
    - **Scalability:** Asynchronous communication helps us work more effectively and efficiently as we scale.
    - **Accessibility and inclusion:** With an emphasis on async communication, our work environment creates a more equitable opportunity to voice one‚Äôs opinion. The loudest voice in the room is no longer the only one who gets heard.
    - **Engaged and happy employees:** We believe that when our team members have the space to live fulfilling lives outside of work, they show up more engaged and productive.
- **Benefits for employees**
    - **Flexibility:** Employees have the freedom of location and time, allowing them to live their life how they want.
    - **Focus:** Defaulting to async communication means employees‚Äô days aren't sliced into meetings. They have space to get into a flow state that produces efficient and satisfying work.
    - **No commute:** Without office buildings and in-person meeting requirements, employees no longer face stressful and time consuming commutes. That time can be reallocated to best serve the employee as a person.
    - **Autonomy:** We trust our employees to get work done when and where they want. This instills a sense of autonomy that is empowering and motivating for employees to be themselves inside work and live their best lives outside of it.
- **It supports our [values](values.md) and culture.**
    - **Transparency always wins:** Honest and open communication allows us to collaborate across time zones.
    - **We value diversity:** We equip our global team members to thrive regardless of location by focusing on asynchronous communication and equitable work practices.
    - **We optimize for the long term:** Intentionally building cultural norms, tooling and processes helps set our growing team up for success.
    - **We work hard and go home:** With more time to focus during work, employees can fully unplug in their personal time.
    - **We are human:** Distributed work supports our employees‚Äô fundamental human-ness. Without strict guidelines on when and where to work, employees experience a quality of life that aligns with their personal interests and values.

### üéóÔ∏è How does dbt Labs support distributed work?

- **Workplace strategy**
    
    A distributed workforce doesn‚Äôt just mean working from home. We realize that different people thrive in different settings. As a result, we offer benefits to support people in finding the right work setup for them and ensuring they are equipped for success:
    
    - **[Office stipend:](benefits.md#office-stipend)** New employees receive $1,500 USD (or local equivalent) to spend in their first year to set up their home office and purchase equipment to comfortably work their preferred location. Each year after, employees receive $400 USD (or local equivalent) to support their remote work setup.
    - **[Workspace rental:](benefits.md#workplace-rental)** Working from home does not work for everyone. Employees receive a monthly benefit to rent office space and experience an optimal work environment.
    - **[Regional offices:](#regional-offices)** In regions with high employee count, dbt Labs has office space to support async-first collaboration and promote our culture and values when teams meet onsite. Designed with intention, these spaces are not used to incentivize local collaboration but instead support community development and foster connection with cross-functional teams during onsites.
- **Global [comp](compensation.md#global-compensation-and-benefits) & [benefits](benefits.md#global-benefits-strategy--stipend)**
    
    We offer a transparent compensation philosophy and intentional benefits to support our global employees. All employees have access to stipends to support health and wellness, phone/internet, professional development and health related travel needs.
    
- **Team construction**
    
    We set up distributed teams to ensure the locations and time zones are conducive to collaboration and connection. Depending on the level of synchronous collaboration needed, some teams are regionalized and others aren‚Äôt. We are thoughtful about the time zone spread to ensure enough work day overlap between globally distributed teammates.
    
- **Tools and systems**
    
    Having the proper tools and systems to support remote work is key to effective communication. We rely heavily on Notion, Slack, and Zoom to keep people connected regardless of where they work. [Open meetings](https://www.notion.so/Open-Internal-Meetings-dee0b870900b4f70898f9c40fcf90719) and office hours are available for team members to foster cross-functional collaboration.
    
- **[Diversity, Equity and Inclusion](#diversity-equity-and-inclusion)**
    
    As a globally distributed company, DEI is critical to our success. DEI is not simply enacted in programs and initiatives, it is woven into the culture of our every day work.
    
- **Employee engagement**
    - We celebrate our unique human-ness and connect beyond business which makes for a welcoming work environment for all. We all get together in-person annually for a company kick-off and we leverage other tools for virtual connection throughout the year.

### How is distributed work actually conducted?

This is a big and important topic. A remote work guide that answers this question is in progress and can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/How-we-work-communicate-9f2b59845baa42209c0134bdb10dfa55). The guide will be udpated with more robust content and link to resources and training throughout the year.

### üåü What are the guiding principles for our distributed experience?

- **Trust and transparency:** We empower individuals and teams with openness and honesty while assuming positive intent.
- **Intentional and explicit:** Our organizational practices and systems are designed with intention to support our distributed workforce. In a remote environment, social cues and cultural norms aren‚Äôt obvious. We are explicit with our communication to provide clarity and context for all.
- **Default to asynchronous:** While async communication may not always be the ultimate way to get work done, it should be the default. Starting with async communication first allows for more effective synchronous communication when needed. It also helps your teammates retain their focus and flexibility by reducing interruptions and distractions.
- **Progress > perfection:** Immediate answers aren‚Äôt expected. With the proper communication and tools in play, employees are empowered to keep iterating and making progress, backed with trust and support.

## Office Strategy

#### Goals of our offices:

1. **Support Community Development:** Establish an environment that embodies and amplifies dbt culture and values.  
    1. Provide a space for teams to use for ‚Äúon-sites‚Äù
    2. Support in-person customer interactions
2. **Drive Productivity:** Provide a space for local employees to work outside the home in lieu of Liquidspace rentals

#### Our offices are NOT:

1. **A place for local team members to collaborate**: meetings need to be inclusive of all team members.  ***In our perfect world, everyone in a meeting is in a Zoom or everyone in the meeting is in a room** (*even if it requires hopping on a plane).  
2. **A marketing effort:**  Many companies use real estate as a status symbol and to amplify their brand awareness.  This is expensive and unrelated to our core workplace values (productivity, inclusivity, and community)
3. **An incentive to work in person vs at home:** We believe the best talent can come from anywhere and support employees in choosing the home and office environment that best serves them. We will not spend money on excessive meal budgets and in-office perks to motivate employees to choose to come in the office vs work at home. 

#### How & when we build offices?

**How we choose where offices go:**

1. **Proximity to team members**
    1. Offices that are near existing concentrations of team members will get the highest utilization
        1. Generally when there are >30 employees within 30 miles of a location we will begin evaluating a permanent space in that region
    2. Offices near existing teams decreases travel spend, as a portion of the team will not need to travel for on-site events
2. **Proximity to partners, customers and other external stakeholders**

**How we determine office size?**

1. Number of employees in the region and estimated growth - **This number is used to determine the number of desks / call rooms we need in the office.** 

*Example:* 

- Average lease term is 3-5 years, so we need to buy space to support the company for a minimum of the next 2 years of growth.
- Currently we are approaching 30 employees w/in 30 miles of San Francisco who would potentially go into the office. Total company headcount growth is expected to grow at 100%+ for the next 2 years, so we want the office to scale to when the bay area team is ~120 people
- If we assume that no more than 50% of employees are in the office on a given day, we would want an office that supports ~60 desks

2. Scale of the organization as a whole, and the need for additional collaboration spaces - **This number is used to determine number of conference rooms/scale of those spaces**

*Example:* 

- Total number of team on-sites being hosted in the office per year
- Average size of the team visiting the office
- Number of external / customer meetings being held in the office

**What is our target layout?*

1. Conference room strategy:
    -  Large rooms to support team on-sites- Optimize rooms to have Zoom Room with great remote collaboration technology so if an employee is unable to travel they can engage with the discussion on their screen
    -  Smaller call rooms so employees can take meetings in a quiet space as needed
    -  Few to zero offices / small breakout spaces to disincentivize in-person collaboration with partial teams
2. Open floor plan with desks to support employees working outside their home as needed

## Regional Offices

In regions with high employee count, dbt Labs has office space to support async-first collaboration and promote our culture and values when teams meet onsite. As outlined in our [office strategy](#office-strategy), these spaces are designed with intention. They are not used to incentivize local collaboration but instead support community development and foster connection with cross-functional teams during offsites.

Learn more about the offices, building access and offsite information [here](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Workplace-7a798fcfa1eb4fba9e061577b6fbb33b?pvs=4).

## Annual Review Cadence

üåè *Note that all dates below are formatted by US dates, so it will be MM/DD*


### Types of Review Cycles

There are two types of review cycles at dbt Labs.

1. [Performance Reviews](#performance-reviews) 

2. [Compensation Reviews & Promotion Cycles](#compensation-reviews--promotion-cycles) 

### Using Culture Amp for reviews

We use Culture Amp for our reviews and it can be accessed through Okta or [here](https://www.cultureamp.com/).

### Cadence

üëâ Each review cycle happens twice per year, meaning we have 4 cycles **total**.

Because of the relationship between performance, and compensation/ promotions, the review cycles are close together, while being separate. This also means that our operating calendar has space for large events (company kick off and Coalesce, for example) to happen without a review cycle in tandem.

### Schedule & Logistics

#### Q1 - Performance

- Reviews Q4 and Q1 performance. (11/1 - 4/30 in any year)
- Includes team members that started before 2/1 and are therefore out of their 30/60/90 day plans.
    - Managers that started after 2/1 will still be responsible for reviewing any eligible team members. They should consult with the team members‚Äô former manager and, if applicable, may add them as a collaborator on the review.
- Everyone will have two weeks to write and complete their reviews (including peer and upwards feedback, if you choose to opt into this). The following month will be when you have a dedicated conversation with your manager to go over everything that was submitted as part of the performance review.

## Performance Reviews

üìå We conduct performance reviews twice a year, in Q1 and Q3. 

### Process Overview

#### Cadence

‚ÑπÔ∏è Performance reviews happen every 6 months and are full ‚Äú360 reviews‚Äù. Performance reviews are done within Culture Amp (which can be accessed via your Okta portal). Culture Amp is our official system of record for performance and engagement.

The performance review consists of a self reflection, peer feedback (optional), upwards feedback (optional), and manager review. 

- Everyone can nominate who they would like to receive peer feedback from.
    - We recommend nominating minimum 2, no more than 5 peers
    - Your manager will need to assign peer feedback requests
    - It‚Äôs highly encouraged for people to submit peer feedback when requested, *but if you do not have the time or feel you do not have sufficient feedback to provide, you are welcome to decline giving feedback in a given cycle.*
- Everyone will be requested to submit upwards feedback about their manager (and this will go to your skip level manager to see; it helps them write their assessment of your manager) however know *this is also completely optional.* Your skip level may share your written feedback with your manager.
- At minimum everyone needs to submit the self-reflection (and if you are a people manager, the manager review for your team members).

#### Purpose

‚ÑπÔ∏è We believe in a continuous feedback culture at dbt Labs. The bi-annual performance reviews are meant to be an intentional check-in to ensure everyone is on track with regards to their development and growth path. You should also know very clearly how you are performing in your current role at the end of the review cycle.

While an overview of how you are doing in your role is an *element* of the review meeting, it‚Äôs also an opportunity for us to learn about what aspects of the role you enjoy the most and how you would like to see your career grow.

It should be a dedicated conversation around topics you normally might not be able to get to or dive in deep during your regular check-ins.

Ideally, nothing written or discussed in your performance review should be a surprise. Our expectation is immediate and consistent feedback is given throughout the year and not only during review season. So why have reviews if we‚Äôre expected to give consistent feedback? For many reasons, these more official checkpoints in the year help us with accountability to summarize that feedback, give us moments to pause and appreciate wins together, and sets aside dedicated spotlight to development conversations.

#### Schedule & Time Commitment

Learn more about the schedule and logistics for our reviews [here](#schedule--logistics) where you'll find [Q1 Performance Review Schedule](#q1---performance) and [Q3 Performance Review Schedule](#q3---performance).

### Meetings & Conversations

‚ÑπÔ∏è Managers are responsible for ensuring:

- reviews are shared with each team member (please share the written reviews 1 day before the scheduled review meeting), and;
- review meetings happens within the designated month

For ICs: this meeting will just be you and your manager (ideally you‚Äôre just expanding an existing 1:1 to talk about reviews).

For People Managers: the meeting will consist of you, your manager, and your skip-level manager. For those extremely cross-functional or embedded, sometimes this might be a leader that is not your skip level.
    - The reason we do this is because we want to ensure your manager development and growth is supported by your management chain.
    - If your work is more cross functional (i.e. you‚Äôre embedded on another team), the leader from the other function might be the most suitable to join you and your manager in your performance review.

#### Performance Definitions

| Evaluation | Definition | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sets a New Standard | Far exceeds expectations. | This person consistently delivers on and exceeds all the expectations and goals of the role. This person demonstrates an exceptional expertise in their areas of responsibilities.  Their quality of work is at the point where others learn that something new/innovation is still possible to be achieved in the context of this role. They influence others to perform and behave better. They consistently exemplify dbt Labs values. |
| Often Exceeds Expectations | Regularly exceeds expectations. | This person consistently delivers on all the core expectations and goals for the role. They either do things at a quality level beyond what was scoped or specified OR the positive impact of the work is larger than what was anticipated. They consistently exemplify dbt Labs values. |
| Consistently Meets Expectations | Consistently meets expectations and sometimes exceeds expectations. | This person delivers on a majority of the core expectations and goals for the role. They consistently exemplify dbt Labs values. This person is doing what they were hired to do. |
| Needs Development | Not consistently delivering on expectations of role. | This person requires additional direction and support in order to get essential parts of the role done. This person isn‚Äôt able to show consistent results expected for the role to produce. Receiving a ‚Äúneeds development‚Äù means active coaching is needed; the manager will need to be more prescriptive about the areas needing change and will need to outline clear next steps for the person to develop into their current role. |
| Not applicable (absent for a majority of the review period) | Neutral evaluation | This person was gone for 4 or more out of the 6 months we are evaluating for this period. |

#### Calibration

‚ÑπÔ∏è Calibration sessions are held with department leaders and their People Business Partner. These sessions should happen after reviews are written and before any meetings or feedback is shared with the team member.

The objective of calibration sessions is to ensure that different managers apply similar standards in measuring and evaluating the performance of our team. All team members get a fair and objective performance evaluation. 

1. **Increase review accuracy.**¬†Unfortunately, one manager‚Äôs idea of a top performer might differ wildly from another‚Äôs - a difference that can dramatically hurt one team and help another. This is because come promotion and raise time, one manager‚Äôs team will have a significant leg up while the other‚Äôs chances will suffer. Calibration ensures reviews are more consistent and accurate.
2. **Properly acknowledge and reward high performance.**¬†Once the bar is set, managers can evaluate employees with more certainty and ensure everyone on their team gets the recognition¬†and reward they deserve.
3. **Reduce bias.**¬†When managers rate their direct reports in a vacuum, they can only compare their direct reports to other teammates or their own idea of what performance should be. Without a calibration discussion, a manager might let unconscious bias¬†influence their decisions and prevent specific reports from receiving a fair review.

- **The calibration process generally operates this way**:
    - All managers submit their performance review feedback and evaluations by the end of the written cycle deadline.
    - Leaders in each org meet as a group to calibrate on their ICs ‚Äî this meeting is facilitated by the People Business Partner.
    - The e-team also receives all the evaluations and meets to review and discuss the performance review evaluation distribution across the org and their direct reports.
    
    **Prior to calibration sessions, senior leaders in each org should understand the feedback for all team members in their org. This may mean reviewing with a frontline manager on your team 1:1 to discuss their team, if they will not be included in the calibration session. Please work with your People Business Partner to determine who will be in the calibration session.** 
    
    We will be using Culture Amp to facilitate the calibration sessions.
    
### Resources 

Check out our [resources](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Performance-Reviews-at-dbt-Labs-054564274f6042a09e1e8515df579e06?pvs=4#538637004b4040a1b571732dfae5425f) to support the performance review process.

## Compensation Reviews & Promotion Cycles

üìå We offer promotion and compensation cycles twice a year, in Q2 and Q4. Any changes will be effective on 8/1 and 2/1 respectively, aligning with our fiscal halves. Having 2 cycles per year is meant to give ample opportunity to reward team members.

**Please make sure to review our [compensation principles](compensation.md#compensation-principles) in order to understand how we think about compensation at dbt Labs.**

### Compensation Reviews

As a general rule, every team member will be eligible for **one** merit compensation review per year*. The cycle each team member is included in will be the cycle **closest** to the start date of the role they are currently in. This will either be their start date with the company or the start date in a new role through promotion or internal mobility.  See the table below to determine who is included in each cycle. 

**Exceptions will be made very rarely with CFO and Head of People approval.*

- Overview of your compensation review based on start month:
    
| Start Month | Cycle Breakdown |
|---|---|
| January | Q4 |
| February* | Q4 |
| March | Q4 |
| April | Q4 |
| May | Q2 |
| June | Q2 |
| July | Q2 |
| August | Q2 |
| September | Q2 |
| October | Q2 |
| November | Q4 (+1 year) |
| December | Q4 (+1 year) |

- We encourage team members to understand when their individual compensation review is so that they can prepare to have the conversations with their manager.

#### Process Overview

Ahead of the cycle, the People Business Partner and Compensation Team will produce a packet of all team members within the eligibility window for merit (minimum of 9 months since starting in their current role **or** 1 year since their last merit increase). The packet will also include merit budget and % recommendations based on performance. 

Managers will propose merit increases for eligible team members. This process will be open for 2 weeks.

**All merit increases must remain in the bounds of the compensation range for the role the team member is currently in.** 

All proposed increases will be reviewed in calibration meetings with leaders in each org to ensure internal equity and keeping in our budget. *Any increases greater than 10% will need CFO approval.* 

Detailed schedule [here](#schedule--logistics).

### Promotion Cycles

As a general rule, team members are eligible for a promotion if they meet a 1 year tenure guideline* AND have shown that they are ready for the next step in their career. This is up to the manager discretion. 

**Exceptions will be made very rarely with CFO and Head of People approval.*

#### Promotion Packets

In order to request a promotion, the manager is responsible for gathering:

‚û°Ô∏è We recommend gathering this feedback through 1:1 conversations and compiling the notes to include in your ‚Äúformal‚Äù packet.

1Ô∏è‚É£ at least 1 current peer review, providing feedback at their current level over, at least, the last 6 months, 

2Ô∏è‚É£¬†at least 1 review from a peer at the level they would be promoted to focusing on areas where they are already contributing at the next level (**if there is no one at the new level, a member of that team‚Äôs leadership team should be included*) to and,

3Ô∏è‚É£ a minimum of 3 reviews **total** to support the promotion application (**if the person up for promotion manages a team, the third review should be an upward review from a member of their team. Otherwise the 3rd review can be a statement of support from a member of that team‚Äôs leadership team*). 

We will create a promotion template in Culture Amp that includes:

- **Justification, if any, for a promotion into a more senior role:** does the business or team *need* someone in an expanded role right now? Is there higher scope or needs that they are currently filling or doing? This should be especially important at the senior and staff level and above.
- **Impact to the business in the last 12 months:** since folks get promoted no more frequently than once a year, we want to take their entire prior year into account when constructing promo packets. This should include quantitative impact statements, quotes from peers, customers, prior performance review data, etc.
- **Examples of how this person is ready for an expanded role:** here, the manager describes behaviors that an individual has shown consistently that tell us they are already operating at the next level.

- The following metadata will already exist in Culture Amp and will be pulled by the People Team:
    - A summary of ratings from the past 12 months of review cycles to paint a picture of the persons trajectory
    - Their tenure at company + time in current role

Promotions will be reviewed and approved in calibration sessions with each org.

#### Schedule & Time Commitment for Compensation & Promotion Reviews

Learn more about the schedule and logistics for our reviews [here](#schedule--logistics) where you'll find the [Q2 Compensation & Promotion Review Schedule](#q2---compensation--promotion) and the [Q4 Compensation & Promotion Review Schedule](#q4---compensation-and-promotion).

## Internal Mobility

Internal mobility applies to those interested in applying to a role outside of your immediate team. Typically, this role will need to be an open requisition with an approved headcount.

We post open roles on our internal career site, [Greenhouse](https://app5.greenhouse.io/internal_job_board/). It is regularly updated, and post roles based on the quarter they are allocated for.

### Eligibility

#### Interdepartmental Transfers

We recommend employees be in their role for at least 9 months before applying to an open requisition within their own department. *(Example: Analytics Engineer ‚Üí Technical Instructor)*

**Why a minimum of 9 months?** The reason we are asking for 9 months for an interdepartmental transfer is because we recognize that there are more transferrable skills and knowledge that exist across roles within a department. 

#### Cross-Department Transfers

We ask that employees be in their role for **at least** 12 months before applying to an open requisition within another department. *(Example: Customer Support Engineer ‚Üí Solutions Architect)*

**Why the minimum of 12 months?** We ask for at least 12 months for a cross-department transfer because it can take about 3 months to onboard onto a new role and another 3 months to become completely ramped into that role (totaling up to 6 months). We would want someone to be working as a ramped member of the team for at **least** 6, ideally 12 months, before moving on. Additionally it could take us longer to backfill your role meaning there are more limitations for the team during the transition period and beyond if you‚Äôre switching to a new department. 

**Exceptions:** Changes or movement between teams could happen at any time due to business needs. If your tenure with dbt Labs is less than the 9 or 12 months and you are interested in moving internally, bring this up to your [People Business Partner](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Find-your-PBP-f54e1de2eefa413bad7eb251a3a7c19f?pvs=4) - the People Team and your current leadership team will need to approve the business exception.

**Again, please ensure you‚Äôre actively talking to your manager about your career goals and development wants/needs.**

## Embedded Roles

#### Why organizational design is hard

Here‚Äôs a scenario: the marketing team at *Company X* needs access to a data analyst to help with marketing analytics. *Company X* already has a centralized data team, but that team reports to the CFO and generally focuses on finance, company strategy, and board reporting. It‚Äôs hard for marketing leadership to get their requests prioritized in the queue, and as a result they‚Äôre getting far less data support than they require.

**There are three things that the marketing team could do:**

1. Make a direct hire: Hire a data analyst to sit on the marketing team.
2. Hire on the data team and expand overall bandwidth: Encourage the data team to hire a new data analyst so that the team‚Äôs overall bandwidth increases and more marketing projects could get prioritized.
3. Hire on the data team and embed in the marketing team: Encourage the data team to hire a new data analyst and then embed that analyst on the marketing team.

It might not actually be clear whether there is a right answer, but there is: it‚Äôs #3. I feel incredibly confident about this for a couple of reasons: 
a) I‚Äôve personally witnessed companies who have attempted to do #1 and #2 and there are universally very poor outcomes, and 
b) this is the model that the entire modern analytics practice is moving towards. 

**Let‚Äôs explore why #1 and #2 don‚Äôt work and why #3 does work.***

**1. Make a direct hire**

This is a bad idea for several reasons:

1. Marketing doesn‚Äôt know how to evaluate the skills of a world-class data analyst. Inevitably, marketers are not as strong in their data skills as pure data professionals, so it will be hard to evaluate candidates and there is a risk that they won‚Äôt be able to choose the right candidate from a pool.
2. World-class data people want to work with other world-class data people. By defining the role in this way, the team is biasing towards candidates who are not world-class.
3. Marketers are poorly-suited to mentor and develop data professionals. The career paths are not aligned, and there is no ability to provide skills-focused development.

Here‚Äôs what actually happens when a team chooses this path:

- They hire a less experienced or less skilled data analyst.
- That team member doesn‚Äôt build skills at the rate that they want or that the team would need. As such, the marketing team is still under-served relative to their initial need.
- There ends up being a local marketing-data-fiefdom that only this analyst knows how to work on. This leads to a low ‚Äúbus factor‚Äù and leaves the marketing function at risk.
- The data analyst eventually quits due to lack of career progression and the marketing team has a big problem on their hands.

We‚Äôve seen this occur time and time again. Often in the past we have been brought in as consultants to help extricate companies from these types of situations and it is never pleasant.

**2.Hire on the data team and expand overall bandwidth**

This is also a bad idea. The core problem with it is that it is too idealistic. It assumes that the reason the data team isn‚Äôt prioritizing marketing requests is really purely one of bandwidth, and if the bandwidth problem is solved then it will go away. [This is not true](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand).

The problem is actually one of prioritization. The charter of the data team in this scenario is finance / strategy / governance. This is why the CFO started the team and why it continues to report up to them. The CFO likely meets weekly with the data team lead, does their performance reviews, and heavily influences their thinking about what‚Äôs important and what isn‚Äôt. Plus, if a new analyst were hired, all of their team members have deep knowledge of the existing set of problems but very little knowledge about marketing problems‚Äîthis will further exert gravity towards having the team continue to focus on the problems it knows how to solve.

This doesn‚Äôt happen because of *malintent*, it is simply an outcome of the fact that the team originally grew up in the finance org. It lacks the connective tissue with marketing to effectively serve this team as a first-class customer.

**3. Hire on the data team and embed in the marketing team**

This solution has a bunch of challenges to *making it work*, but if an organization can solve them, it is by far the highest-functioning option. Here‚Äôs how it works:

- Marketing leadership allocates a data analyst headcount to their hiring plan, working with the data team to make sure that leveling and compensation are appropriate for the work needed.
- Data hires a new analyst. This new hire may be allocated to marketing, or may backfill an existing analyst who would then be allocated to marketing.
- The marketing analyst works with the marketing organization to set a roadmap of priorities, and works with the data team to determine the implementation strategy for these priorities. Outputs are reviewed by the marketing team and code is reviewed by the data team. Both teams make a good-faith effort to consider the others‚Äô needs as the ongoing balance between quality and speed is figured out.
- The embedded marketing analyst goes to team meetings for both the marketing team and the data team. Quarterly reviews for this analyst are conducted by leadership on both the data and marketing teams.

**Here‚Äôs why this approach is superior:**

1. It enables world-class data professionals to interview, onboard, collaborate with, and manage other world-class data professionals. This leads to better hiring decisions, better skills mentoring, better career development, and overall happier team members that then stick around for longer.
2. It enables embedded analysts to build expertise in and empathy for the problem domain.
3. It ensures that the marketing team actually gets the bandwidth they originally needed.

There is a clear cost to this approach: it makes management within a given department more challenging. For example, if the engineering department houses a front-end engineer and an implementation engineer, what teams (platform / experience) do those individuals report to? Also: staying informed about an embedded team member‚Äôs performance is harder for their direct manager.

In the immediate term we don‚Äôt believe that these challenges should prevent us from moving forward with the embedded approach, but we do want to be cognizant of them and monitor these potential breaking points as the team scales.

#### Data is a great example, but this problem isn‚Äôt exclusive to data

Any specific area of expertise tends to work in this way. Marketing and product both need design resources yet there shouldn‚Äôt be two design teams. Marketing and engineering both need front-end development resources. Everyone needs data. Sales needs engineering resources (implementation engineers!). Soon we plan on hiring internal ‚Äúops‚Äù people who work on customizing our business systems like our CRM, support platform, and marketing operations platform.

All of these roles are similar in that they require specific functional expertise and need to work closely with multiple departments throughout the company.

#### Why doesn‚Äôt everyone do it this way?

Because it conflicts with how most organizations are run.

At traditional organizations, leaders are held accountable to metrics and get budget allocated to their departments to move those metrics. The budget a leader has allocated to them determines how likely they are to achieve their goals. And given that continued employment and incentive-based compensation are highly aligned with leaders‚Äô ability to hit their goals, there is tremendous pressure to ‚Äúnot share your legos‚Äù. Any dollar I share with you is one less dollar I can spend to hit my own goal, after all.

In my role running marketing at RJMetrics, this was on clear display. I had a lead goal that I was held accountable to as my sole determinant of success. As such, I deprioritized every aspect of marketing that wasn‚Äôt related to generating new leads. I didn‚Äôt share my legos.

At the time, this felt completely natural. The marketing function existed to generate leads and so it was my job to do that as well as I could. Saying no to other priorities was actually part of what was hard about the job, and it was important for me to not allow ‚Äúmission creep‚Äù to set in.

But when everyone in the organization thought like this, it led to a tremendous amount of local optimization. We had best-in-class functional organizations, but we were completely unable to do anything that didn‚Äôt fall neatly into a single functional organization.

Conventional wisdom is to manage departmental leaders in exactly this way. This goes back to Taylorism / Fordism in the early 20th century, and it‚Äôs something that is still widely practiced. This is one of the reasons that large / traditional organizations become fantastically well-oiled machines to do some particular process well (i.e. build an internal combustion engine car) but find it incredibly hard to *change* (i.e., build an electric car): their org structures are hierarchical and lack flexibility.

#### How we want to do this differently

This problem has been something that I‚Äôve been hyper-focused on since starting Fishtown Analytics (former name of dbt Labs). I saw the negative impacts of this previously and wanted to steer hard in the opposite direction. Connor and Drew and I have focused on building a culture that emphasizes cross-departmental collaboration since the very beginning, and when we‚Äôve hired or promoted people into leadership roles we‚Äôve heavily focused on people who are wired to be collaborative.

As a result, we‚Äôve had notable successes on this front in our short life as a company: the dbt community and dbt Learn are both programs that live in a highly cross-functional space. It‚Äôs a tremendous credit to everyone involved in these programs for operating in a zone of some level of ambiguity.

But even with this success, it‚Äôs naive to assume that just ‚Äúhiring collaborative people‚Äù is an answer to a systems problem. Ultimately, we‚Äôre all products of the systems we inhabit, and we have to design those systems well in order to get the outcomes we want. Here are my suggestions to continue to keep Fishtown Analytics focused on cross-departmental collaboration over the long run:

- **Establish clear cross-departmental budgetary mechanisms.** For example, make a clear mechanism whereby marketing can allocate budget for a data analyst hire that will ultimately live on the data team. Note that this needs to handle the scenario where multiple departments want to contribute a % of an FTE towards a single full-time hire.
- **Minimize executive compensation that is tied to anything but overall equity value.** We don‚Äôt have to remove incentive-based compensation that is tied to specific metrics altogether, but it should always be a distant personal priority for every executive when weighed against the success of the overall business.
- **Create a new company value: ‚ÄúWe share our legos.‚Äù** Culture is one of the biggest tools we have to shape behavior, and our values are the best tool we have for shaping culture.
- **Answer the [hard questions](#questions-to-ask) about cross-departmental roles up-front.** 
- **Abolish fiefdoms.** Kill the idea that departmental strategy is set and budgets are allocated at the sole discretion of the leader of that department. All leaders can weigh in on the strategic choices and budgets of other departments, and these concerns need to be addressed prior to moving ahead with the proposed plans. Use the OKR-setting process to make sure that goals are aligned across different departments.

### Questions to Ask

**What questions need to be answered prior to hiring for an embedded role?**

1. **Who will be this person‚Äôs manager?** A manager will, in the case of an embedded team member, likely not be the person who is setting the day-to-day tasks for this person. Rather, they are responsible for supporting the person‚Äôs career development, providing mentorship, etc. There should only be a single answer to this question.
2. **Who will the ‚Äúembed sponsor‚Äù be?** The embed sponsor will be a member of the team ‚Äúhosting‚Äù this person who will be primarily responsible for determining the day-to-day workload of this person. It is recommended that there is only one answer to this question, as balancing across multiple embed workloads can be challenging.
3. **Who will make the final hiring decision?** We recommend that this should be the same as the answer to #1 above, with the understanding that the person in #2 will have a high degree of input.
4. **Who will participate in this person‚Äôs reviews?** Likely this should be the people from #1 and #2, above.
5. **How long will this embedded relationship last?** Generally, there is a ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù that allows the embedded team member to spend adequate time with the functional area to develop expertise and add value, but not so long on the team that they develop a ‚Äúbus factor‚Äù and become a turnover risk. Most often we feel that the appropriate range here is 6-24 months, but realize that your mileage may vary.
6. **What is this person‚Äôs career path within the company?** We should make sure that we‚Äôre not creating dead-end roles for embedded team members. This can sometimes happen when a person‚Äôs role doesn‚Äôt have obvious next steps outside of the team that they are embedded with. We should prevent this situation as it will lead to employee turnover.

## Global Employment

### Country Hiring Guidelines

We have members in countries and regions all over the world and from all walks of life. We value diversity. As we grow, we will continue to explore our hiring capabilities in a variety of geographies.

All of our roles are remote, however some roles may carry specific location or time zone eligibility requirements. Our [Talent Acquisition team](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Business-Partner-Coverage-Model-0a4ee30503464b3bb101de1d4c3ac5e8) can help answer any questions applicants may have about location after starting the recruiting process.

In the past, dbt Labs would hire in any country except those we had already determined were not feasible due to certain restrictions. At present we are focusing our hiring in countries where we have¬†entities; exceptions will be made rarely and must have approval by our CFO*. For exceptions, we ask for a 6 month lead time so that we can properly investigate employing someone in that country and take necessary steps to be able to do so legally.

*To request an exception:

1. Please contact the Head of People with the following:
    1. The country
    2. The role you would like to hire in that country
    3. Why this country over one where we have an entity.
2. The G&A team (Finance, Accounting, Legal and People) will investigate the benefits and risks of entering there

**With this process; there are 3 types of employment relationships:**

1. Direct employment with a dbt Labs entity
    1. We will look into opening in entities in countries where we have a large employee count or if there is a business case where an entity would be beneficial.
2. Non-resident payroll through our dbt Labs entity
3. EOR employment through our current* vendor Remote.com, legally, this relationship is a contractor relationship
    1. *Vendor relationship subject to change to accommodate business and team member needs.

üìå **Any country not listed in this doc must be reviewed by a member of the People and Finance team prior to opening that country for hiring.**

*Note: In some cases, hiring foreign nationals of other countries into positions where they may gain access to proprietary technology or software may require export licenses. This is not a ban on hiring, but it is highly fact-specific, and must be assessed in conjunction with the People team and Legal team, in compliance with applicable anti-discrimination and employment laws.*

### Relocation (Permanent or Semi-permanent)

üìå All international relocation requests must be approved by the People team, Finance team and the team members management. To initiate a request, please contact your [People Business Partner](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Find-your-PBP-f54e1de2eefa413bad7eb251a3a7c19f?pvs=4).

üìå Relocation requests within one's existing country may need approval by the team member's management due to time zone or regional requirements. Please communicate with your manager if you plan a move to a different region in your country.

If a team member chooses to relocate within each country (ex. from London ‚Üí Manchester or Boston ‚Üí Chicago), their compensation will not change. However, if the relocation is to a different country, they will be re-aligned to the new country‚Äôs compensation bands. This applies both when moving to a lower and higher cost market. 

Compensation bands for each country we have an entity in will be listed in our compensation database. As we grow, new data will be added to capture roles located in each country.

**What to consider before moving?**

‚è≥ Please initiate a move at least 3 months before your target move date. This allows us to process necessary approvals and make sure we‚Äôre able to execute the transfer.

1. If the team member is moving to a new country, the move must have prior approval by their [People Business Partner](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Find-your-PBP-f54e1de2eefa413bad7eb251a3a7c19f?pvs=4), the dbt Labs finance team, their manager and their team‚Äôs leadership.
    1. Please allow for one month for approvals.
2. All moves should be to a country where we have a dbt Labs entity. 
    1. Any international moves outside of countries we have a presence in, must be approved by the CFO and be to a location where there is a business case. We ask for a 6 month lead time to determine if this move is possible
3. Team members must obtain their own work authorization to work in the country they are moving to. For moves initiated by the team member, dbt Labs will not cover expenses for work authorization. 
4. If a move is initiated by a team member, we will not cover any relocation or living expenses. 
5. We encourage team members to consult with a tax advisor to understand the implications of the move as it relates to tax and equity. 
    1. **Please remember that your compensation will be updated to reflect the local market you are moving to.**  

### Short-Term Relocation

üìÖ Generally, team members may live or work outside their permanent residence for an aggregate amount of 183 days (6 months) per year. However, the amount does depend on the particular country (or state) and what it considers to be a "resident" for tax purposes, as well as what it considers the tax year.

Any work being done in a country where we do not have a current presence must be approved by security to ensure access to our systems remains secure. Please submit a ticket with IT prior to confirming your working arrangements in that country. 

If a team member is considering spending more than **one month** in a location outside of your home country, please consult with your [People Business Partner](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Find-your-PBP-f54e1de2eefa413bad7eb251a3a7c19f?pvs=4) to ensure we are mitigating risks to the team member and the business. 

Team members are expected to communicate with their manager and team to ensure they maintain agreed upon working hours.

### Equity

**ISO Options:**  If a team member chooses to relocate and holds ISO options, the number of options that are unvested will be converted to NSO options.  If the team member has options that vested as ISOs, they will be able to retain the ISO status.  When the team member relocates, the Equity team will cancel the existing ISO grant(s) and reissue NSO grant(s) for the unvested portion of the original grant within Carta.  The grant will retain all of the other original terms (strike price, vesting period, etc.)

**NSO options:**  If a team member chooses to relocate and holds NSO options, nothing will change.

üöß There are different tax consequences for ISO and NSO options.  Additionally, tax rules vary across jurisdictions.  Employees are strongly encouraged to consult with a tax advisor before making any relocation decision.

‚ÄºÔ∏è **If there is a lapse in providing services to the Company, this will qualify as a termination and all unvested options will be canceled.  If a team member is rehired and resumes providing services to the Company, any grant associated with employment will need to go through the new hire process for equity.  This means that a team member would receive a new strike price, vesting period, etc.**

## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

We are committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion. DEI impacts high-level company decisions, and is woven into the culture of everyday work.

We have three DEI committees dedicated to Team Diversity, Culture, and Company Stance and Action. Together, these committees make sure we build a diverse team, equitable company structures, and an environment that gives everyone the support and opportunities they need to thrive.

## Conscientious Objection

**Conscientious objection is the right of an individual to withhold their labor.**

Individual employees have the ability to opt out of working on a project or with a client that violates a deeply-held conviction.

We each commit to bringing our whole self to work. Conscientious objection makes space for when a major part of our self conflicts with a major part of our work. 

An example from [Tristan‚Äôs writing on this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12nAw4podecG2JWNcslAMlakujmATzXdgkCbfwLPR0sI/view#):

‚ÄúWe ask an employee, who happens to be vegan, to work closely with Tyson Foods. This employee does the work and does it well, but it‚Äôs a major engagement that takes ~a third of their time for many months. After a month, this employee becomes frustrated and starts to look for other jobs.

The problem we‚Äôre trying to solve here is individual misery created by forcing someone to do work that violates a deeply-held conviction.‚Äù

Conscientious objection applies when a high percentage of your time is directed towards a single client or project for a prolonged period (weeks or months). This will mostly apply to the pro-serv team, some SA and SD relationships, and some implementation engineering. 

üó£Ô∏è **If your work conflicts with your deeply held beliefs, talk to your manager.**

If you are assigned to a project or long-term relationship with a client that violates your deeply held beliefs, communicate to your manager that you want to be reassigned to a different project or client. Your manager must work in good faith to accommodate the request. If your work is going to make you miserable and hurt your soul, the whole team will suffer‚Äî it‚Äôs in everyone‚Äôs best interest to make a change. [Again, from Tristan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12nAw4podecG2JWNcslAMlakujmATzXdgkCbfwLPR0sI/view#): 

‚ÄúThis is not their direct report ‚Äònot being a team player‚Äô‚Äîrather, it is their direct report optimizing for the long-term. Managers who fail to accommodate such requests risk having high-turnover teams, which will limit their own ability to be successful.‚Äù

If you need additional support working with your manager to figure out an accommodation, you can reach out to your [People Business Partner](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/Find-your-PBP-f54e1de2eefa413bad7eb251a3a7c19f?pvs=4).

üõ† **We can help find other solutions when conscientious objection doesn‚Äôt solve the problem**

If work that conflicts with your deeply held beliefs is a regular and predictable part of your role rather than an exception, and your right to conscientious objection is impeding the team‚Äôs overall success, the best long-term solution may be to look for a role that‚Äôs a better fit. You can work with your manager and your People Business Partner to move towards a different role within the company that is more aligned with your personal values. 

üí° You can see some of the discussion that led to this policy in [Working Document: Conscientious Objection](https://www.notion.so/Working-Document-Conscientious-Objection-31977f6aa61b447fabc4f5ac6a20f02f).

## Getting Support

We ensure team members receive the support they need. We offer different options depending on the question or situation.

#### Getting Support from the People Team

1. **Ticketing System**: This is your best option to get the fastest response to questions about benefits, reimbursements, stipends,  and payroll. Ask a people question using our ticking system in #people-support. 
2. **People Business Partners (PBP)**: This is the best option when you‚Äôre seeking confidentiality and don‚Äôt feel comfortable going to your manager. PBPs are a resource for when you may want to confidentially, or anonymously, report an issue in the workplace. They can help answer and support you with any questions, concerns, or feedback about your time at dbt Labs. 

#### Getting Support from the outside People Team

1. **Peer Advocate Program**: This is the best option when you‚Äôre seeking an alternative route to voice feedback or ideas about the company at large.Peer Advocates is designed to provide an alternate route of communication with leadership and the team at large, for employees seeking to get feedback from peers, test ideas, or offer feedback with anonymity. 
2. **Anonymous Hotline**: This is your best option to workplace issues or suspected illegal or unethical conduct anonymously. The Anonymous Hotline offers additional option for anonymous reporting but please remember you can always reach out to your manager, People Business Partner, Peer Advocates or a member of leadership directly about any issues you are having.
