## [Our Distributed Work Experience](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/How-we-think-about-the-Distributed-Experience-5edaf90eafad420b9a05ffc03a3cc5c7?pvs=4)

Learn how we think about the distributed experience.

### üìò First, let‚Äôs define some terms‚Ä¶

- **Workplace Strategy:** Workplace strategy answers the question: ‚ÄúWhere do we work that optimizes for effectiveness and efficiency?‚Äù. Possible answers include: fully distributed, hybrid, office-only.
- **Asynchronous Work:** A way of working that does not require all team members to be online simultaneously. Asynchronous work is required for teams to function across multiple time zones. Often when we say ‚Äúdistributed work‚Äù we actually mean ‚Äúdistributed and asynchronous work‚Äù because our company is spread across many time zones globally. ‚ÄúDistributed‚Äù is commonly used as shorthand.
- **Employee Experience:** The journey an employee takes with an organization. It includes every interaction that happens along the employee life cycle, including the experiences that involve an employee's role, workspace, manager and wellbeing.

- **Distributed Work Experience (simply, "Distributed Experience"):** The employee experience specifically related to how work gets done in a distributed work environment. Communication, tools, processes and culture enable distributed work. The distributed experience could be liberating or constraining, agile or inflexible, fast or slow, equitable or inequitable. When you find yourself saying something like ‚ÄúI never know where to find information‚Äù you are making a comment about your personal distributed experience.

### üåê What is our workplace strategy?

Our workplace strategy is **fully distributed**. This does not mean we won‚Äôt gather in person and won‚Äôt have office space. Instead, it means that the primary mode of getting work done assumes employees are not physically in the same location. We believe this is better for both our company and its employees.

### ‚ú® What is our approach to support the distributed experience?

A great distributed experience doesn‚Äôt just happen on its own. Employees have been working in offices for a *very long time* and have evolved norms of behavior for how work gets done. Distributed work is far newer. As a result, we can‚Äôt rely on a shared understanding of how to work effectively in this context. We must be extremely *intentional* about how the distributed experience is constructed. When done successfully, we are confident the distributed experience is more effective, enjoyable, and equitable than traditional office-based work.

**Intentionally designing a distributed experience includes:**

- Defining cultural principles and norms of behavior that support distributed work
- Investing in tooling and processes that support distributed work
- Training everyone on how work gets done in a distributed work environment

### ü§î Why does the distributed experience matter?

Having a great distributed experience helps both our company and our employees. It also helps us live our values.

- **Benefits for dbt Labs**
    - **Widens our talent pool:** Without the limitations of a physical location, we can hire top talent across the globe.
    - **Productivity:** Our team spends less time in meetings and has more time to focus.
    - **Scalability:** Asynchronous communication helps us work more effectively and efficiently as we scale.
    - **Accessibility and inclusion:** With an emphasis on async communication, our work environment creates a more equitable opportunity to voice one‚Äôs opinion. The loudest voice in the room is no longer the only one who gets heard.
    - **Engaged and happy employees:** We believe that when our team members have the space to live fulfilling lives outside of work, they show up more engaged and productive.
- **Benefits for employees**
    - **Flexibility:** Employees have the freedom of location and time, allowing them to live their life how they want.
    - **Focus:** Defaulting to async communication means employees‚Äô days aren't sliced into meetings. They have space to get into a flow state that produces efficient and satisfying work.
    - **No commute:** Without office buildings and in-person meeting requirements, employees no longer face stressful and time consuming commutes. That time can be reallocated to best serve the employee as a person.
    - **Autonomy:** We trust our employees to get work done when and where they want. This instills a sense of autonomy that is empowering and motivating for employees to be themselves inside work and live their best lives outside of it.
- **It supports our [values](https://github.com/dbt-labs/corp/blob/main/values.md) and culture.**
    - **Transparency always wins:** Honest and open communication allows us to collaborate across time zones.
    - **We value diversity:** We equip our global team members to thrive regardless of location by focusing on asynchronous communication and equitable work practices.
    - **We optimize for the long term:** Intentionally building cultural norms, tooling and processes helps set our growing team up for success.
    - **We work hard and go home:** With more time to focus during work, employees can fully unplug in their personal time.
    - **We are human:** Distributed work supports our employees‚Äô fundamental human-ness. Without strict guidelines on when and where to work, employees experience a quality of life that aligns with their personal interests and values.

### üéóÔ∏è How does dbt Labs support distributed work?

- **Workplace strategy**
    
    A distributed workforce doesn‚Äôt just mean working from home. We realize that different people thrive in different settings. As a result, we offer benefits to support people in finding the right work setup for them and ensuring they are equipped for success:
    
    - **[Office stipend:](https://www.notion.so/Office-Stipend-5f5a37d1026d4fb78ee3c6439fada6dc)** New employees receive $1,500 USD (or local equivalent) to spend in the first 60 days to set up their home office and purchase equipment to comfortably work their preferred location. Each year, employees receive $400 USD (or local equivalent) to support their remote work setup.
    - **[Workspace rental:](https://www.notion.so/Our-Workplace-Rental-Experience-LiquidSpace-6ce02b65bdf4469989b5864ae7f410fc)** Working from home does not work for everyone. Employees receive a monthly benefit to rent office space and experience an optimal work environment.
    - **[Regional offices:](https://www.notion.so/Workplace-7a798fcfa1eb4fba9e061577b6fbb33b)** In regions with high employee count, dbt Labs has office space to support async-first collaboration and promote our culture and values when teams meet onsite. Designed with intention, these spaces are not used to incentivize local collaboration but instead support community development and foster connection with cross-functional teams during onsites.
- **Global [comp](https://www.notion.so/dbt-Labs-Compensation-Principles-0d570903e75e45fc8f9f3fca13a77d00) & [benefits](https://www.notion.so/Benefits-Hub-9d4f4f11706d4f399719dd0abf5b273d)**
    
    We offer a transparent compensation philosophy and intentional benefits to support our global employees. All employees have access to stipends to support health and wellness, phone/internet, professional development and health related travel needs.
    
- **Team construction**
    
    We set up distributed teams to ensure the locations and time zones are conducive to collaboration and connection. Depending on the level of synchronous collaboration needed, some teams are regionalized and others aren‚Äôt. We are thoughtful about the time zone spread to ensure enough work day overlap between globally distributed teammates.
    
- **Tools and systems**
    
    Having the proper tools and systems to support remote work is key to effective communication. We rely heavily on Notion, Slack, and Zoom to keep people connected regardless of where they work. [Open meetings](https://www.notion.so/Open-Internal-Meetings-dee0b870900b4f70898f9c40fcf90719) and office hours are available for team members to foster cross-functional collaboration.
    
- **[Diversity, Equity and Inclusion](https://www.notion.so/Diversity-Equity-and-Inclusion-e4d1b91f0f1f4f96a8759171173d4af8)**
    
    As a globally distributed company, DEI is critical to our success. DEI is not simply enacted in programs and initiatives, it is woven into the culture of our every day work.
    
- **Employee engagement**
    - We celebrate our unique human-ness and connect beyond business which makes for a welcoming work environment for all. We all get together in-person annually for a company kick-off and we leverage other tools for virtual connection throughout the year.

### üöß How is distributed work actually conducted?

This is a big and important topic. A remote work guide that answers this question is a focus in the coming quarters! As this comes together, we'll update this section with more robust content and link to resources and training.

### üåü What are the guiding principles for our distributed experience?

- **Trust and transparency:** We empower individuals and teams with openness and honesty while assuming positive intent.
- **Intentional and explicit:** Our organizational practices and systems are designed with intention to support our distributed workforce. In a remote environment, social cues and cultural norms aren‚Äôt obvious. We are explicit with our communication to provide clarity and context for all.
- **Default to asynchronous:** While async communication may not always be the ultimate way to get work done, it should be the default. Starting with async communication first allows for more effective synchronous communication when needed. It also helps your teammates retain their focus and flexibility by reducing interruptions and distractions.
- **Progress > perfection:** Immediate answers aren‚Äôt expected. With the proper communication and tools in play, employees are empowered to keep iterating and making progress, backed with trust and support.
